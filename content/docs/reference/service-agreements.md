Every client has unique needs, and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are tailored to fit those specific requirements. These agreements are outlined in the contract to provide the highest level of support and service.

---

## Why SLAs Matter

- **Clarity:** Clearly sets expectations for service delivery.  
- **Accountability:** Defines accountability for both parties.  
- **Performance Measurement:** Offers benchmarks to evaluate service quality.  
- **Problem Resolution:** Simplifies addressing service issues.  
- **Improved Relationship:** Enhances communication and establishes shared standards.

---

## How SLAs Work

### Agreed Upon in Contracts  
The SLA is included in the contract to ensure all terms are clear and agreed upon before beginning the collaboration.

### Flexible and Specific  
SLAs can cover a range of services and components, including:  
- **Response Times:** Deadlines for inquiries and support requests.  
- **Project Milestones:** Defined timelines and key phases.  
- **Support Availability:** Availability of assistance when needed.  
- **Roles and Responsibilities:** Clarification of responsibilities for all involved.  
- **Performance Tracking:** Methods for monitoring and reporting service quality.  
- **Accountability:** Consequences for not meeting agreed-upon standards.  
- **Review and Updates:** Processes for periodic reviews and updates.

## What is an SLA?  

A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a formal document that outlines the scope, responsibilities, and quality of service to be provided. It serves as a mutual understanding between the client and the service provider, ensuring transparency and measurable standards.

---

## Practical Examples  

Here are examples of how SLAs function in practice:  

- **Critical Response Times:** If a client requires a response to critical inquiries within 4 business hours, the SLA will clearly specify this expectation.  
- **Project Milestones:** Defined timelines for delivering specific project phases ensure accountability for all parties.

## Time Tracking and Transparent Billing  

Accurate time tracking ensures clear and transparent billing for all services provided. For more details, visit the [Transparent Billing](/time-tracking.md) page.

## Potential Breaches Due to Client Delays

SLAs may be adjusted if delays result from necessary client actions. In such cases, the timeline or responsibilities may be updated. Examples include:  
- **Data Dependency:** Delayed project milestones due to pending client-provided data.  
- **Approvals:** Delays in required approvals for changes or milestones.  
- **Change Management:** Extended timeframes for approval processes.  
- **Client Communication:** Awaiting responses to messages or requests.  
- **Pending Payments:** Delayed progression due to unpaid invoices.  
- **Work Review:** Pending client review or feedback on completed work.

## Monitoring and Reporting  

Performance tracking is carried out using a combination of automated reporting tools, periodic reviews, and collaborative status meetings. These methods ensure transparency and allow adjustments if needed.

---

## Mutual Responsibilities  

Both the client and service provider have key roles to play in achieving success:  
- **Client Responsibilities:** Providing timely approvals and necessary information.  
- **Service Provider Responsibilities:** Delivering services within agreed timelines and quality benchmarks.

---

## Dispute Resolution  

In the event of disagreements regarding service delivery, a defined escalation process is in place. This ensures a structured approach to resolving issues quickly and efficiently.

---

## Non-Compliance Scenarios  

If SLA terms are not met, corrective actions will be discussed and implemented. This could include adjustments to service processes or revisions to the SLA itself.

---

## A Commitment to Collaboration  

The SLA is a living document designed to adapt to your evolving needs. By working together and maintaining open communication, the goal is to deliver services that align with your expectations and priorities.

Please note that SLAs may be adjusted in instances where delays are caused by **necessary client actions**. In such scenarios, the responsibility for any resulting delays is not assumed. Examples include, but are not limited to:

- **Data Dependency:** If a project milestone relies on receiving specific data from the client and that data is delayed, the SLA timelines may be adjusted accordingly.

- **Approvals:** Any necessary approvals that need to be reviewed and finalized before a change can be implemented.

- **Change Management:** Changes requiring approval as part of change management that are taking several days to finalize.

- **Client Communication:** Waiting for the client to reply to messages.

- **Pending Payments:** Awaiting settlement for completed milestones before progressing further.

- **Work Review:** Waiting for the client to review and provide comments on completed work.
