Every client has unique needs, and our Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are customized to fit those specific requirements. These SLAs are outlined in the contract to ensure the highest level of support and service.

## Why SLAs Matter

- **Clarity:** Sets clear expectations on service delivery.

- **Accountability:** Establishes accountability for both parties.

- **Performance Measurement:** Provides benchmarks for evaluating service quality.

- **Problem Resolution:** Streamlines the process for addressing service issues.

- **Improved Relationship:** Enhances our relationship through clear communication and agreed-upon standards.

## How SLAs Work

### Agreed Upon in Contracts
The SLA is included in your contract or contracts, where appropriate. This ensures that all terms are clear and agreed upon before initiating our collaboration.

### Flexible and Specific
SLAs encompass a broad spectrum of services and components, such as:

- **Response Times:** Specifying deadlines for inquiries and support requests.

- **Project Milestones:** Defining deadlines and key milestones for project phases.

- **Support Availability:** Ensuring the availability of support staff.

- **Roles and Responsibilities:** Clarifying the roles and responsibilities of all parties involved.

- **Performance Tracking:** Outlining how service performance will be monitored and reported.

- **Accountability:** Detailing the consequences for not meeting performance standards.

- **Review and Updates:** Establishing a process for regularly reviewing and updating the SLA.

## Potential Breaches Due to Client Delays

{{< callout context="caution" title="Caution" icon="outline/alert-triangle" >}}
Please note that SLAs may be adjusted in instances where delays are caused by **necessary client actions**. In such scenarios, the responsibility for any resulting delays is not assumed. Examples include, but are not limited to:

- **Data Dependency:** If a project milestone relies on receiving specific data from the client and that data is delayed, the SLA timelines may be adjusted accordingly.

- **Approvals:** Any necessary approvals that need to be reviewed and finalized before a change can be implemented.

- **Change Management:** Changes requiring approval as part of change management that are taking several days to finalize.

- **Client Communication:** Waiting for the client to reply to messages.

- **Pending Payments:** Awaiting settlement for completed milestones before progressing further.

- **Work Review:** Waiting for the client to review and provide comments on completed work.
