## ⚡ Addressing challenges

### **Proactive solutions for delays**

Sometimes, delays are unavoidable due to factors like:

- 🕒 Late feedback or missing data.
- 🔄 Extended decision-making for change requests.
- 💳 Payment delays or unresolved queries.

In such cases, adjustments will be made collaboratively to reflect new timelines while keeping the project on track.
