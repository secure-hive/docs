[Toggl Track](https://toggl.com/) is used to ensure precise and efficient tracking of the hours we bill to you. This keeps everything transparent and accurate in all our consulting work.

{{< callout context="note" title="Note" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
Hourly billing tracking applies only to hourly projects. Fixed-price projects are not tracked by the hour but managed through [Upwork's milestone features](https://support.upwork.com/hc/en-us/articles/211068218-Milestones-for-Fixed-Price-Jobs) to keep everything organized and on track. This allows us to divide the project into manageable phases, each with its own due date and deliverables.{{< /callout >}}
