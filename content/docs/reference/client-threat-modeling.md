{{< details "TLDR" open >}}
Threat modeling is a proactive way to spot and address potential security risks in systems, applications, and data. Much like being cautious when driving, it helps you identify and mitigate dangers early on. This process emphasizes collaboration, measurable outcomes (like reducing remediation time by a certain percentage), and the importance of addressing threats before they become real issues. By mapping where trust boundaries exist and focusing on areas of greatest impact, threat modeling ensures your most critical assets stay secure and adaptable to evolving threats.

## Understanding threat modeling
Threat modeling is a structured approach to identifying and addressing potential risks to systems, applications, and data. In everyday life, we engage in a form of threat modeling all the time. For example, when driving, you assess potential risks—like other cars, weather conditions, or pedestrians—and take steps to avoid accidents. Similarly, in cybersecurity, threat modeling helps identify vulnerabilities and plan defenses to mitigate them effectively.

By fostering collaboration and focusing on measurable outcomes, it ensures that critical assets are effectively safeguarded. For example, measurable outcomes might include reducing the average time to remediate identified vulnerabilities by 30% or achieving a specific improvement in system uptime through proactive threat management. It provides a proactive framework for uncovering vulnerabilities and implementing safeguards to protect critical assets. By addressing threats early, threat modeling helps prevent issues before they arise, delivering measurable security improvements.

## Elevating security through actionable threat modeling

This approach aligns with the principles of the [Threat Modeling Manifesto](https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/), which emphasizes integrating security into the design process. These principles ensure that threat modeling remains practical, actionable, and aligned with overarching security goals.


## Why threat modeling matters

Threat modeling is valuable at any stage of a project. While it is most effective when introduced early, applying it to existing systems or during updates is equally impactful. For instance, think about reviewing household finances: identifying potential risks such as unexpected expenses allows proactive steps like creating an emergency fund. In the same way, revisiting existing systems through threat modeling ensures critical risks are identified and mitigated.

For example, consider reviewing how household finances are managed. Identifying risks like unexpected expenses or income loss allows proactive steps like creating an emergency fund. In the same way, revisiting existing systems through threat modeling ensures that critical risks are identified and mitigated effectively.

For instance, when applied to a legacy application, threat modeling can reveal outdated authentication mechanisms or encryption protocols, enabling teams to address critical vulnerabilities. Similarly, during system upgrades, threat modeling ensures that new features do not introduce unexpected risks, maintaining the overall security posture. Continuous threat modeling ensures that evolving threats are addressed as they emerge, helping systems remain resilient and adaptive over time. This ensures that:

- Risks are identified and addressed proactively.  
- Security becomes a built-in component of system design.  
- Systems remain resilient as they adapt and evolve.  
- No threat is considered too far-fetched. Every possibility is acknowledged, and mutual responsibility is emphasized in prioritizing risks based on their potential impact and likelihood.

{{< callout context="tip" title="Collaborative brainstorming" icon="outline/rocket" >}}
Working together to brainstorm risks ensures that no known critical threats are overlooked. This process draws on diverse perspectives, which helps uncover potential risks that might otherwise be missed.

This collaborative approach ensures resources are directed to address the most pressing challenges effectively. This approach ensures resources are directed where they are needed most, providing efficient and effective risk management.


## Key information required for threat modeling

To perform threat modeling effectively, specific details about the system, product, or service are needed:

- **Assets to Protect**: Identify critical data and functions requiring protection. These should be represented in an application diagram, such as a Data Flow Diagram (DFD).  
- **General Product Information**: Include architecture details, use cases, and operational context.  
- **Access Control Protocols**: Define roles, permissions, and authentication mechanisms.  
- **Cryptographic Practices**: Document cryptographic algorithms, secure communication protocols, and random number generation sources used.  
- **Secrets Management**:  
  - Include cryptographic keys (excluding test keys), PINs, passwords, and other sensitive secrets.  
- **Software Components**: List all components and their update mechanisms. These should be represented in diagrams or documentation.  
- **External Interfaces**: Document any interfaces and corresponding authentication mechanisms.  
- **Network Security Measures**:  
  - Include spoofing prevention mechanisms.  
  - Outline denial-of-service detection and monitoring capabilities.  
- **Processing Records**: Ensure logging and data flow details are included for compliance and auditing.


## Understanding trust boundaries

Trust boundaries are a critical concept in threat modeling. They represent the points in a system where different levels of trust intersect. For example, a trust boundary may exist between a public-facing web application and the internal database it accesses. Crossing a trust boundary typically involves a transition in access permissions, authentication, or other security controls.

In threat modeling, trust boundaries help identify areas where:

- Data flows between trusted and untrusted entities.  
- Security controls need to be enforced (e.g., authentication, encryption).  
- Vulnerabilities could be introduced by improper validation or insufficient protections.

By mapping trust boundaries in diagrams such as Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs), it becomes easier to:

- Visualize where threats may emerge.  
- Define security requirements at critical points.  
- Prioritize mitigations for high-risk transitions.

{{< callout context="note" title="Understanding trust boundaries" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
Consider this example: sharing personal data with a friend versus a stranger. With friends, you share more freely; with strangers, you add protections like withholding sensitive details. Trust boundaries in systems work the same way.
{{< /callout >}}

For example, a trust boundary may exist between a user-facing web application and an internal database it accesses. Proper controls, such as authentication and encryption, must be in place to ensure data integrity and restrict unauthorized access when crossing this boundary.

## What is the difference between threat modeling and threat analysis?

Threat modeling is a **proactive** process that focuses on predicting potential threats, identifying vulnerabilities, and designing mitigations. It is theoretical in nature, centering on understanding and reducing risks before they materialize.

Threat analysis, on the other hand, is a **reactive** process that examines how existing vulnerabilities could be exploited. It often requires a technical understanding of attack vectors and focuses on the likelihood and consequences of exploitation.

In essence:

- **Threat modeling** anticipates risks.  
- **Threat analysis** evaluates existing risks and how they might be exploited.

Both approaches complement one another to create a robust security framework.

## How risk factors into threat modeling

Risk is at the core of the threat modeling process. Identified threats are assessed for:

- **Impact**: The potential damage or consequences if the threat is realized.  
- **Likelihood**: The probability that the threat will occur.

By combining these factors, risks can be prioritized, ensuring that resources are allocated effectively to mitigate the most significant risks first. Documenting these risks in a risk register provides visibility and accountability, making risk management an ongoing and actionable process.

## Documenting the threat modeling process

Threat modeling can be documented using one of two approaches:

- **In code**: When integrated into development workflows, tools like [Threagile](https://github.com/Threagile/threagile) provide a seamless way to generate and manage threat models directly within the codebase. This approach supports clarity by embedding threat modeling directly into the development process and ensures collaboration between developers and security professionals.  
- **Using dedicated tools**: Platforms like [IriusRisk Community Edition](https://www.iriusrisk.com/community) offer structured templates and collaboration features for documenting and tracking threat models effectively. These tools enhance clarity by providing standardized formats and foster collaboration through shared access and reporting capabilities.

## Making threat modeling actionable

The outputs of threat modeling must feed directly into a risk register, ensuring identified risks are tracked, prioritized, and mitigated. This connection ensures threat modeling aligns with broader risk management processes, providing clear and measurable outcomes.

## Steps in threat modeling

A structured process ensures thorough and efficient threat modeling:

1. **Identify assets**: Determine what data and functions need protection.  
2. **Understand the system**: Document architecture, data flows, and trust boundaries.  
3. **Identify threats**: Use established methodologies to evaluate potential risks.  
4. **Prioritize risks**: Focus on high-impact and high-likelihood threats.  
5. **Design mitigations**: Develop safeguards to address prioritized risks.

## Tools and techniques

Effective threat modeling relies on simple and clear techniques:

- **Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)**: Map how data moves through the system, highlighting trust boundaries and potential vulnerabilities. DFDs are particularly useful for gaining insights into new or evolving systems.  
- **Attack Trees**: Break down potential attacker objectives into hierarchical steps, showing how threats could materialize and what conditions would enable them.  
- **STRIDE**: A systematic method for identifying six key threat categories: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege. STRIDE is applicable to any team and is particularly beneficial for those new to threat modeling due to its straightforward approach. It simplifies the process by categorizing threats into six distinct areas, making it easy to identify and address specific vulnerabilities without requiring extensive prior experience. However, STRIDE’s generality can sometimes overlook nuanced or highly specific risks, making it less effective for advanced threat scenarios.  
- **PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)**: A risk-centric methodology that models threats based on attack simulations. PASTA is most suited for more established teams with mature risk management processes, as it provides detailed insights into business impact and strategic risks. However, PASTA can be resource-intensive, requiring significant time and expertise to implement effectively. Break down potential attacker objectives into smaller, manageable steps, making it easier to identify vulnerabilities and develop mitigations.

## Metrics for prioritization

Threat modeling uses measurable metrics, such as Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF), to evaluate and prioritize risks. MTBF measures system reliability, helping identify where vulnerabilities are likely to be exploited.

To calculate MTBF:

- Record total operational time.  
- Divide by the number of failures during that time.  

**Formula:**

```bash {title="Formula"} 
MTBF = (Total Operational Time) / (Number of Failures)
```

Using metrics like MTBF ensures a data-driven approach to risk prioritization and resource allocation. Additionally, metrics such as CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) or exposure analysis can complement MTBF, providing a more comprehensive evaluation of risks and their potential impacts.
