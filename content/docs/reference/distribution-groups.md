A distribution group is an email address that forwards messages to a relevant contact. This approach helps avoid overlooked inquiries and maintain a structured flow of communication.

## Benefits of distribution groups

- **Centralized contact:** Each address is dedicated to a specific area (e.g., billing, feedback).  
- **Improved turnaround:** Messages are routed immediately, supporting efficient handling.  
- **Triage by priority:** Emails are evaluated according to legal obligations and prority. For example, a Data Subject Access Request (DSAR) must be addressed within a legally defined timeframe, while a security incident may be escalated for immediate attention.

## Guidelines for effective communication

- **Include relevant information:** Account details, screenshots, or examples can help expedite resolution.  
- **Use the correct channel:** Selecting the most suitable distribution group helps direct your inquiry promptly.

## Key takeaways

1. **Dedicated routes:** Each distribution group is aligned with a specific topic‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs billing, security, or general feedback. This reduces confusion and ensures that messages land with the appropriate contact from the start.

2. **Priority-based triage:** Inquiries are assessed based on legal requirements (e.g., DSAR timeframes) or urgency (e.g., security incidents). This helps address critical matters quickly while ensuring all other inquiries are handled in a timely manner.

3. **Clear requests:** Providing thorough details‚Äîlike screenshots or order numbers‚Äîhelps prevent back-and-forth emails and supports faster resolution. When your request is clear, it‚Äôs easier for the recipient to act quickly and accurately.

4. **Incident escalation:** [Signal Messenger](https://signal.org/ "Signal Messenger") is an alternative channel for urgent incidents that cannot wait for standard email response times. This ensures that emergencies receive immediate attention.

5. **Data protection focus:** Adherence to data protection regulations, such as GDPR, underscores a commitment to privacy and transparency. Handling personal data responsibly helps build trust and maintains compliance with legal standards.
