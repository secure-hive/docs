## With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility

At Secure Hive, accountability and efficiency are key. That’s why the concept of Directly Responsible Individuals (DRIs) is embraced, similar to industry leaders like Apple and GitLab. DRIs ensure that every task, project, and decision has a clear owner, leading to faster and more effective outcomes.

### Why DRIs Matter to You

Efficiency is enhanced by DRIs by making it clear who is responsible for each task. This saves time, avoids confusion, and ensures that things get done. Here’s how DRIs benefit you:

#### Fast Decision-Making
DRIs have the authority to make decisions within their area. This results in quicker solutions without delays from seeking multiple approvals.

#### Clear Goals
Goals relevant to their responsibilities are set and achieved by DRIs. They ensure tasks are completed efficiently and effectively.

#### Resource Coordination
DRIs gather and coordinate everything required for success. This could involve:

- Getting budget approvals.
- Acquiring necessary tools or software.
- Coordinating with other teams for support.

This proactive approach ensures projects run smoothly and efficiently.

## Working with Maintainers

Sometimes, changes to certain files are made by multiple experts called “maintainers,” even if there's a dedicated DRI. This often occurs when Secure Hive acts as a maintainer for a client’s repository. In these cases, expertise is brought in to ensure changes are made efficiently and effectively.

## Meet Your DRI

Internally, Brandon Maytham serves as the only Directly Responsible Individual at Secure Hive. This means inquiries are handled personally. While this ensures consistent and dedicated support, it is recognised as a limitation during busy periods. However, a commitment is made to maintain the highest standards of service for you.
