Got a question? Need help? Want to share feedback? You're in the right place. Use the dedicated contact channels. Each address is monitored for quick responses, ensuring your inquiry is handled swiftly and efficiently.

## What Are Email Relays?

**Digital Postmen**: Just like mail carriers, these systems ensure your emails get delivered to the right address. They route your messages to the appropriate team, making sure nothing gets lost.

We stick to our Service Level Agreements (SLAs) to ensure you get timely responses. Check out our [SLA documentation](https://www.securehive.com/sla) for more details.

## Dedicated Contact Channels

I aim to respond within the specified minimum response time (Min RT).

## Tackling the Bottleneck

{{< callout context="note" title="Note" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
Right now, all email relays come to me, Brandon Maytham. While this ensures a consistent and dedicated response, it can create a bottleneck. I plan to address this in the future, but it depends on hiring and has no immediate solution.
