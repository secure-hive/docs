Email relays are the backbone of efficient communication. Whether you have a question, need assistance, or want to share feedback, these systems ensure your message is delivered to the right contact quickly and securely. With dedicated channels for specific needs, inquiries are routed efficiently, minimizing delays and confusion.  

## What Are Email Relays?  

Email relays act as automated systems that route messages to the appropriate contact point, ensuring inquiries are organized and efficiently addressed. By streamlining communication, they help reduce delays and ensure every message is routed to the right place.  

By adhering to Service Level Agreements (SLAs), email relays provide timely, consistent responses. For more details on response times and commitments, refer to the [SLA Documentation](service-agreements).  

## Dedicated Contact Channels
