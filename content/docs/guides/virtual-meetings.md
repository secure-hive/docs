Meetings are more than just scheduled conversations—they’re opportunities to align, collaborate, and deliver results. Designed with clarity and professionalism in mind, this guide ensures every meeting is purposeful, efficient, and respectful of participants' time.

## The benefits of structured meetings  

Well-organized meetings deliver measurable outcomes:  

- **Clarity and alignment**  
  Clear agendas and actionable goals ensure everyone is on the same page.  

- **Professionalism and preparation**  
  Arriving prepared demonstrates respect for participants’ time and builds trust.  

- **Focused outcomes**  
  Defined action items and follow-ups create accountability and drive progress.  

## Preparing for meetings  

Joining a meeting prepared ensures it begins on time and without disruption.  

- **Arrive early**: Joining 5 minutes before the scheduled start time allows for testing of cameras, microphones, and headsets.  
- **Have a backup**: A spare headset should be kept ready in case of unexpected technical issues.

Arriving early demonstrates professionalism, ensures a smooth start, and avoids wasting participants’ time.

When billing by the hour, timers must be running before the meeting begins.

## Joining meetings  

To maintain a professional and distraction-free environment, these practices are followed when joining meetings:  

- **Cameras and microphones**:  
  - Cameras and microphones are kept off when joining to avoid interruptions caused by background noise or unintended video distractions.  
  - Cameras are turned on when presenting, when others have theirs on, or when requested.  
  - When unsure, clarification is sought on whether cameras are to remain on.  

- **Setup readiness**: Meeting equipment, such as cameras and microphones, must be tested and operational to ensure full participation.  

{{< callout context="note" title="Why keep cameras and microphones off initially?" icon="outline/video-camera" >}}  
Starting this way minimizes potential disruptions and allows participants to settle into the meeting smoothly.

## Running the agenda  

A clear agenda ensures meetings are productive, with actionable outcomes.  

- **Client-led meetings**: When the meeting is called by a client, the agenda is set and driven by them.  
- **Internally-led meetings**:  
   - The **Directly Responsible Individual (DRI)** prepares and shares the agenda in advance using the [Meeting Agenda Template](#) (to be created).  
   - Agendas must be attached to meeting invites for participant alignment.  
   - A notetaker is designated to capture key points and action items.  

{{< callout context="note" title="What is a DRI?" icon="outline/user-circle" >}}  
The **DRI** is the person scheduling the meeting. They ensure the meeting has a clear purpose, actionable outcomes, and proper documentation.  
{{< /callout >}}  

Meetings without an agenda or clear purpose are rescheduled or canceled.  

## Taking and sharing notes  

Accurate and well-structured notes are essential for tracking progress and ensuring accountability.  

- **Documenting during the meeting**: Notes include:  
   - Decisions made.  
   - Action items and their assignments.  
   - Next steps and follow-up timelines.  

- **Reviewing and classifying notes**:  
   - Notes are cleaned for grammar and clarity using available tools.  
   - Labels are applied according to the [Data Classification Policy](#).  

- **Sharing promptly**: Notes are distributed to participants shortly after the meeting to maintain alignment.  

{{< callout context="tip" title="Why review and classify notes?" icon="outline/document-text" >}}  
Clear, accurate notes ensure all participants understand their responsibilities and that sensitive information is handled appropriately.

## Call recordings and transcription  

Meetings are not recorded or transcribed unless necessary.  

- **Permitted recordings**:  
   - Legal requirements.  
   - HR-related matters.  
   - Client requests.  

- **Transparency and consent**: Participants are informed before recording, the reason for the recording is provided, and the option to leave the call is offered.  

{{< callout context="note" title="Why this policy?" icon="outline/shield-check" >}}  
Recording is only permitted when necessary to protect privacy and ensure transparency.

## Scheduling meetings  

- **External meetings**: Client-facing meetings are scheduled using [Cal.com](https://cal.com/brandon.m) for a seamless and professional experience.  
- **Internal meetings**: Internal meetings are booked directly in calendars and conducted via **Signal Messenger** for secure collaboration.  

{{< callout context="note" title="Why use Signal for internal meetings?" icon="outline/shield" >}}  
Signal Messenger is designed to prioritize privacy and security with:  
- **Privacy by Design**: Signal does not collect or store metadata, ensuring conversations remain private.  
- **No AI Use or Abuse**: Unlike other platforms, Signal does not analyze, monetize, or exploit communications.  
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Each message is encrypted with unique keys, meaning even if one key is compromised, previous conversations remain secure.  
- **Cross-Device Support**: Signal seamlessly integrates across desktop and mobile for flexible communication.

- **Adding participants**: Participants are added as pre-established groups (e.g., teams or departments) wherever possible, rather than individually.  

{{< callout context="tip" title="Why add participants as groups?" icon="outline/users" >}}  
Using groups minimizes the risk of missing participants and ensures efficient scheduling.  
{{< /callout >}}

- **Time buffers**: A buffer of at least 20 minutes is maintained between meetings to prevent delays, allow mental resets, and prepare for subsequent discussions.  

{{< callout context="tip" title="Why schedule with buffers?" icon="outline/refresh" >}}  
Buffers prevent back-to-back meetings, reducing stress and improving focus.

## External meetings  

External meetings reflect professionalism and client-focused organization.  

- Cameras are turned on when presenting, when others have theirs on, or when requested.  
- Microphones remain muted when not speaking to minimize background noise.  

{{< callout context="note" title="Professionalism matters" icon="outline/briefcase" >}}  
External meetings are an opportunity to build trust and deliver value. Time is respected by ensuring preparedness, organization, and focus.  
{{< /callout >}}

## Key principles for meetings  

1. **Be prepared**: Arrive early, test equipment, and keep a backup headset ready.  
2. **Always have an agenda**: No agenda, no meeting. Agendas must be attached to invites.  
3. **Take actionable notes**: Record decisions, assign follow-ups, and classify notes appropriately.  
4. **Respect client leadership**: Client meetings are led by clients unless otherwise agreed.  
5. **Add participants as groups**: Scheduling groups ensures all relevant attendees are included.  
6. **Maintain buffers**: A 20-minute buffer prevents delays and allows mental preparation.  
7. **Follow recording policies**: Recording or transcription is permitted only when necessary and with consent.
