Meetings are more than just scheduled conversations—they’re opportunities to align, collaborate, and deliver results. This guide provides a structured approach to ensure every meeting is purposeful, efficient, and respectful of participants' time.

## The benefits of structured meetings  

Structured meetings create clarity and drive measurable outcomes:  

- **Clarity and alignment**  
  Clear agendas and actionable goals ensure discussions stay focused and productive.  

- **Professionalism and preparation**  
  Joining prepared respects participants' time and builds trust.  

- **Focused outcomes**  
  Defined action items and follow-ups create accountability and measurable progress.  

## Why prioritize asynchronous communication?  

While meetings are valuable, **asynchronous communication** is the preferred approach for most day-to-day interactions. This method reduces inefficiencies, emphasizes documentation, and creates a reliable source of truth.

### What is asynchronous communication?  

Asynchronous communication involves sharing information without requiring immediate responses. Common examples include:  
- Emails  
- Documentation  
- Project updates  

### Why choose asynchronous communication?  

- **Reduces interruptions**: Allows for deeper focus and increased productivity.  
- **Prioritizes documentation-first workflows**: Ensures information is shared, distributed, and preserved as a reliable reference, avoiding bottlenecks.  
- **Supports flexibility**: Accommodates different schedules and time zones, enabling meaningful contributions.

Asynchronous communication ensures clients always have access to up-to-date, well-documented information. This approach enhances transparency, reduces delays, and creates a reliable foundation for collaboration.

### When to schedule a meeting  

Meetings should be reserved for discussions that:  
- Require real-time collaboration or decision-making.  
- Involve brainstorming or resolving complex issues.  

> **Note**: Avoid scheduling meetings about routine updates or minor queries. Use asynchronous channels wherever possible.  

## Preparing for meetings  

Preparation ensures meetings start smoothly and achieve their intended outcomes.  

- **Arrive early**: Joining 5 minutes before the start time allows for testing of cameras, microphones, and headsets.  
- **Have a backup**: Keeping a spare headset available minimizes disruptions caused by technical issues.  

{{< callout context="tip" title="Why arrive early?" icon="outline/clock" >}}  
Early preparation prevents delays, respects others’ time, and ensures a professional start to every meeting.

For billable meetings, ensure timers are running before the session begins.

## Joining meetings  

To maintain a professional and distraction-free environment, follow these best practices:  

- **Cameras and microphones**:  
  - Cameras and microphones are kept off when joining to protect privacy and reduce interruptions.  
  - Cameras are turned on when presenting, when others have theirs on, or when requested.  
  - If unsure, clarify whether cameras should remain on.  

- **Setup readiness**: Ensure all equipment, including cameras and microphones, is tested and operational.  

{{< callout context="note" title="Why keep cameras and microphones off initially?" icon="outline/video-camera" >}}  
Starting with cameras and microphones off safeguards privacy, minimizes distractions, and ensures participants are ready before engaging.

## Running the agenda  

A structured agenda ensures meetings are focused, efficient, and actionable.  

- **Client-led meetings**: For client-initiated meetings, the agenda is driven by the client.  
- **Internally-led meetings**:  
   - The **Directly Responsible Individual (DRI)** prepares and shares the agenda in advance using the [Meeting Agenda Template](#) (to be created).  
   - Agendas must be attached to meeting invites for alignment.  
   - A notetaker is designated to record key points, decisions, and next steps.  

{{< callout context="note" title="What is a DRI?" icon="outline/user-circle" >}}  
The **DRI** is the individual responsible for scheduling the meeting. They ensure it has clear objectives, outcomes, and documentation.  
{{< /callout >}}  

Meetings without a clear agenda or purpose should be rescheduled or canceled.

## Taking and sharing notes  

Accurate and structured notes are essential for tracking progress and ensuring accountability.  

- **Document during the meeting:** Record:  
   - Key decisions made.  
   - Assigned action items.  
   - Agreed next steps and timelines.  

- **Review and refine notes**: Notes should be checked for accuracy, grammar, and clarity before sharing.  
- **Classify notes appropriately**: Apply labels according to the [Data Classification Policy](#).  
- **Distribute notes promptly**: Notes are shared via a secure link for easy access and reference.  

{{< callout context="tip" title="Why share clear and actionable notes?" icon="outline/document-text" >}}  
Well-structured notes create a reliable record, reduce misunderstandings, and ensure alignment on next steps.

## Call recordings and transcription  

Recording and transcription are limited to specific cases where they are necessary.  

- **When recordings are allowed**:  
   - To meet legal or regulatory requirements.  
   - For personnel or workplace matters requiring formal documentation.  
   - At the client's request.  

- **Transparency and consent**: Participants are informed before recording, the reason is explained, and the option to leave the call is provided.  

{{< callout context="note" title="Why limit recordings?" icon="outline/shield-check" >}}  
Restricting recordings protects privacy, ensures transparency, and maintains professionalism.

## Scheduling meetings  

- **External meetings**: Client-facing meetings are scheduled via [Cal.com](https://cal.com/brandon.m) for a seamless experience.  
- **Internal meetings**: Internal meetings are booked directly in calendars and conducted via [Signal Messenger](https://signal.org).  

{{< callout context="note" title="Why use Signal for internal meetings?" icon="outline/shield" >}}  
Signal Messenger ensures secure, private communication with:  
- **Privacy by Design**: Signal does not collect or store metadata, ensuring confidentiality.  
- **No AI Use or Abuse**: Conversations are not analyzed, monetized, or exploited.  
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Unique encryption keys for each message protect previous conversations, even if a key is compromised.  
- **Cross-Device Support**: Seamlessly integrates across desktop and mobile for flexible communication.

- **Adding participants**: Add participants as pre-established groups rather than individuals to streamline scheduling and avoid errors.  

{{< callout context="tip" title="Why add participants as groups?" icon="outline/users" >}}  
Using groups ensures all relevant participants are included, simplifies scheduling, and avoids unnecessary notifications.  
{{< /callout >}}

- **Time buffers**: Maintain a 20-minute buffer between meetings to accommodate overruns and allow preparation.  

{{< callout context="tip" title="Why schedule with buffers?" icon="outline/refresh" >}}  
Buffers reduce stress, prevent overlap, and ensure readiness for the next session.

## External meetings  

External meetings present opportunities to build trust and deliver results.  

- Cameras are turned on when presenting, when others have theirs on, or when requested.  
- Microphones remain muted when not speaking to minimize background noise.  

{{< callout context="note" title="Professionalism matters" icon="outline/briefcase" >}}  
External meetings demonstrate preparedness, organization, and respect for client time.

## Key principles for meetings  

1. **Asynchronous first**: Prioritize documentation and asynchronous communication to minimize unnecessary meetings.  
2. **Be prepared**: Arrive early, test equipment, and have a backup headset ready.  
3. **Always have an agenda**: No agenda, no meeting. Attach agendas to invites.  
4. **Take actionable notes**: Record decisions, assign follow-ups, and classify notes appropriately.  
5. **Respect client leadership**: Client meetings are led by the client unless otherwise agreed.  
6. **Add participants as groups**: Ensures all relevant attendees are included and avoids redundant notifications.  
7. **Maintain buffers**: A 20-minute buffer prevents delays and allows preparation.  
8. **Follow recording policies**: Recording or transcription is only permitted when necessary and with consent.  

By adhering to these principles, meetings become focused, productive, and respectful of time, fostering trust and collaboration.
