## Who Gets the Green Light?

These policies are inclusive for every member of our teamâ€”whether you're a contractor, freelancer, or full-time staff. If you're part of our payroll, these guidelines are designed to support you.

## Keeping Our Policies Fresh and Relevant

### Stay Updated with Industry Changes

We regularly review and update our policies based on industry changes, new evidence, incidents, or emerging concerns. Our zero-knowledge model means we focus on significant industry shifts rather than an annual review. This targeted approach keeps our security measures sharp and efficient.

### Evolving Our Policies

#### Collaborative Updates: Our Team Approach

We use GitHub pull requests (PRs) with an approval flow to document and manage policy changes. This structured approach ensures multiple stakeholders review and approve changes before they are implemented. It keeps our process transparent and creates a clear audit trail of policy revisions.

### Guided by Reliable Information

We base our policies on the latest information from reputable and credible sources in our industry. This ensures our guidelines are always comprehensive and up-to-date.

{{< callout context="tip" title="Tip" icon="rocket" >}} Our policies are designed to be practical and proactive, aligning with [UK Cyber Essentials](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberessentials/overview). This government-backed scheme helps organizations protect themselves against common cyber threats, ensuring we maintain a secure and efficient work environment at Secure Hive. {{< /callout >}}
