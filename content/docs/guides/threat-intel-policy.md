## From Insight to Action

We know you’re dedicated to staying ahead of threats—that's why you’re reading this. Like you, we don't wait for problems to arise; we actively hunt down threats before they can disrupt your operations. This policy is your guide to how we gather and analyse threat intelligence. With these insights, our team is always ready to tackle potential threats head-on, ensuring your digital world stays secure and protected.

## Our Strategic Objectives

Here’s what we’re aiming for with our threat intelligence strategy:

- **Get the Facts Right:** We gather precise, detailed intelligence so you know exactly what we’re dealing with.

- **Take Action Fast:** We provide clear, practical advice for dealing with threats right away using runbooks. Runbooks are step-by-step guides that our team follows to respond quickly and effectively to threats, so you can feel secure.

- **Use Resources Wisely:** We focus on the threats that matter most to make the best use of our resources. For example, we prioritize threats that target our core systems and critical data, ensuring our efforts have the most significant impact on your safety.

- **Keep It Consistent:** We maintain a consistent and measurable approach through standardized practices. We use established protocols and regular training to ensure everyone on our team handles threats in a uniform way, giving you reliable protection.

- **Stay Legal and Ethical:** We ensure all our intelligence activities are legally compliant and ethically conducted, respecting privacy and data protection. For instance, the Sensitive Data Scanner helps us meet compliance goals by discovering, classifying, and redacting sensitive data in real-time. It scans for patterns of sensitive data upon ingestion and then hashes or redacts it following built-in or user-defined rules to help us stay compliant with UK Data Protection Act etc.

## Unlocking the Power of Threat Intelligence

We explore threat intelligence through three essential layers, with always-on, real-time data streaming. News sources are checked daily, and some sources, like reports, are checked as released:

### Big-Picture Insights: Strategic Threat Intelligence

- **Focus:** Identifying adversaries, their goals, and their methods.
- **Sources:** National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), news outlets, and industry reports.

### Detailed Insights: Tactical Threat Intelligence

- **Focus:** Analysing specific attackers, their techniques, and strategies.
- **Sources:** Hacker News, Ground News, and our internal monitoring systems.

### Immediate Alerts: Operational Threat Intelligence

- **Focus:** Providing current data on active threats, including indicators of compromise.
- **Sources:** Monitoring tools, professional forums, alerts, and platforms like CrowdSec or Cloudflare.

## Harnessing Collective Intelligence

We don’t keep our intelligence to ourselves. We actively share and receive threat info with peers who face similar challenges. Furthermore, we use trusted sources and networks tailored to our industry, location, and technology. Plus, we maintain an internal list of reliable threat sources to ensure we always have the best information at our fingertips.

## Handling Threats: Our Protocols

To manage threats effectively, we have clear escalation protocols:

### Who Needs to Know

- **Team Notifications:** Principal Consultants, Security, IT, most crucially client points of contact if necessary, and law enforcement if applicable.

- **Timely Reporting:**  Communication of threats and suggested actions, based on relevance.

- **Client Transparency:** We keep you in the loop about threats, impacts, and mitigation strategies. Check our Client Reporting Process for more details.

### Urgency Classification

We use a simple system to classify threats by how serious they are and what impact they might have. This helps us prioritize and tackle threats efficiently. For more details, you can refer to our Vulnerability Management Policy.

## Playing by the Rules

At Secure Hive, we ensure all our activities are law-abiding by:

- **Following Legal Guidelines:** Adhering to all relevant laws and regulations in our threat intelligence activities.

- **Respecting Privacy:** Ensuring our practices comply with privacy laws and respect individuals’ data rights.

- **Regular Training:** Providing ongoing training for our team on legal and ethical standards.

- **Clear Policies:** Establishing clear internal policies and procedures that align with legal requirements. Refer to our Legal Compliance Policy for more information.
