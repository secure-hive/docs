Policies are essential statements of fact, representing the security posture and established practices at the time they are created or updated. Designed to evolve with changing circumstances, they provide:

- **Transparency:** Clear expectations and processes.  
- **Clarity:** Simplified steps to reduce complexity.  
- **Accountability:** Defined roles and responsibilities.  
- **Adaptability:** Updates made in response to evolving needs and changes.

> **Policies reflect the current state**  
> Policies represent the security posture and operational standards at the time of issuance. Updates follow a **handbook-first strategy**, ensuring changes are documented before being implemented across other areas.  

## A dynamic approach to policy updates

Policies are not reviewed on an annual cycle; instead, they are updated dynamically using a **handbook-first strategy**. This ensures that all updates are documented in the handbook first before being communicated and implemented. By addressing changes in real-time, the risk of gaps or outdated practices is minimized.

Key triggers for policy updates include:  

- **Threat assessments:** Regular evaluations of potential risks inform updates, ensuring policies stay aligned with emerging threats.  
- **New regulations:** Changes in standards such as GDPR or Cyber Essentials prompt immediate policy adjustments.  
- **Operational insights:** Feedback from personnel or practical implementation drives policy refinements.

> **Why real-time updates matter**  
> Using a handbook-first strategy ensures that all changes are clearly documented and shared promptly, reducing the risk of miscommunication or misalignment.  

## Scope of the policies

These policies apply to all individuals working with systems, data, or operational processes. This includes:  

- Contractors  
- Freelancers  
- Full-time personnel  

Unless otherwise stated in an individual policy, the same rules and guidelines apply universally to everyone. Consistent expectations ensure clarity across all levels of engagement.

> **Who these policies apply to**  
> Policies ensure that everyone involved, regardless of role or contract type, follows the same clear guidelines unless specifically excluded in an individual policy.  

## How policies are approved

Policy changes follow a transparent and structured approval process:

1. **Drafting:** Proposed changes are written based on operational feedback, threat assessments, incidents, or regulatory updates.  
2. **Review:** Changes are shared using GitHub pull requests (PRs), enabling collaborative review and discussion.  
3. **Approval:** Revisions are finalized after careful review and agreement by stakeholders.  
4. **Implementation:** Approved updates are reflected in the handbook first, followed by clear, actionable communication to personnel.

### What is a GitHub pull request?  

A GitHub pull request (PR) is a formal way to propose changes to documents or systems. Contributors suggest edits, which are then reviewed, discussed, and approved or rejected. This ensures transparency, collaboration, and a clear record of revisions. Every change remains traceable, with a documented history of who suggested and approved it.

## Common policy areas based on Cyber Essentials

The policies are designed to align with the **Cyber Essentials** framework, focusing on key areas that address common cybersecurity needs:

- **Access control:** Policies defining who has access to systems and data.  
- **Firewalls and internet gateways:** Guidelines for securing networks.  
- **Secure configuration:** Ensuring systems are configured to reduce vulnerabilities.  
- **Patch management:** Requiring timely updates to software and operating systems.  
- **Malware protection:** Rules for preventing and managing malicious software.

> **Aligned with Cyber Essentials**  
> Policies focus on areas outlined in Cyber Essentials, providing a foundation for effective protection against common cybersecurity threats.  

## Keeping policies relevant

Policies are continuously updated to reflect practical experiences, threat assessments, industry changes, and regulatory updates. Examples include:  

> **Real-world events shaping policies**  
> - **Incident-driven update:** A phishing attempt compromises a login account. The password policy is updated to require stronger passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA).  
> - **Threat assessment update:** A review identifies an increase in ransomware attacks. Policies are updated to include enhanced training on email attachment safety.  
> - **Regulatory-driven update:** Updates to GDPR rules prompt adjustments in data handling and retention policies.  

## Reporting policy concerns

Concerns or potential breaches of policy should be reported to **security@securehive.co**. Unless stated otherwise, this is the primary contact for addressing issues.

> **How to provide feedback on policies**  
> Feedback is essential for keeping policies relevant and practical. To suggest improvements or report concerns, email **security@securehive.co** with the details of the policy in question. Constructive feedback drives better alignment with real-world needs.  

## Maintaining policies through regular review

Policies are subject to ongoing review and improvement through a structured process:  

1. **Monitoring developments:** Keeping pace with updates in regulations, standards, and threat landscapes.  
2. **Threat assessments:** Evaluating new risks and vulnerabilities to inform updates.  
3. **Proposing updates:** Transparent changes are shared and reviewed using formal processes.  
4. **Implementing changes:** Updates are reflected in the handbook first, followed by clear communication with actionable steps.

## Roles and responsibilities

**Your role**  
- Follow the policies as outlined.  
- Promptly report any concerns or potential issues.

**Commitment to policy development**  
- Ensure alignment with trusted sources and industry standards.  
- Communicate updates clearly and provide actionable instructions.  
- Maintain transparency and traceability in the approval process.

> **Feedback ensures policy alignment**  
> Timely adherence to and feedback on policies ensures they remain relevant and aligned with real-world needs.  

## Policies as evolving statements of security

Policies serve as an accurate reflection of the current security posture and practices at the time they are issued. They adapt to meet new challenges, align with evolving industry standards like Cyber Essentials, and incorporate feedback. By focusing on clarity, accountability, and adaptability, policies provide a reliable foundation for effective and responsible operations.
