## Defense in Action: Physical Security Guidelines

Your vigilance is key to protecting our assets and sensitive data. This policy guides you on keeping things secure, whether you're at your desk, on the move, or in a meeting.

## Choose the Right Space: Temporary Offices and Co-working Spaces

### Space Selection
- **Select Wisely:** Opt for reputable spaces with strong physical security.
- **Watchful Eyes:** Require video surveillance in common areas and entry points.
- **Secure Wi-Fi:** Use Wi-Fi with strong encryption like WPA3.
- **Lock and Load:** Implement physical security measures like locked doors and alarms.
- **Check Twice:** Verify security measures before booking.

## CCTV Use in Temporary Offices, Co-working Spaces, and In-person Events

### Remote Adaptation of CCTV
As the team operates primarily on a remote basis, CCTV usage applies to **temporary offices, co-working spaces, and in-person events**. In these settings, CCTV can play a crucial role in enhancing security, controlling access, and providing reassurance. However, since these spaces are not fully under our control, specific limitations and risks regarding privacy must be acknowledged.

### Purpose and Use
- **Security Enhancement:** CCTV in shared spaces is primarily used to monitor and deter unauthorized access, prevent theft, and protect sensitive assets and employees during in-person activities.
- **Shared Responsibility:** The use of CCTV in these venues is typically managed by the venue owners. We cannot guarantee that CCTV systems will be limited to certain hours or specific areas, as many venues operate 24/7 recording policies, which may include additional features such as **facial recognition technology**. Be aware of the potential for broader surveillance.

### UK Legislation and Privacy Concerns
- **Compliance with UK Law:** CCTV use in these settings must comply with UK privacy legislation, including the **Data Protection Act 2018** and the **UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR)**. Employees and third parties should be aware of their rights concerning recorded data, including their ability to request access or challenge improper use.
- **Third-Party Providers:** In co-working spaces or other third-party venues, CCTV footage is often controlled by the provider, meaning they act as the data controller. While efforts will be made to communicate with the venue to ensure data privacy compliance, employees should remain vigilant of the venue's privacy practices, especially regarding **continuous recording** and **advanced technologies like facial recognition**.

### Privacy Considerations
- **No Guarantees on Recording Times:** While the preference is for minimal and focused recording, some venues may employ 24/7 surveillance. This can include monitoring outside event times or in areas unrelated to our activities. Be cautious and familiar with the venue’s policies when attending.
- **Use of Facial Recognition:** Some locations may deploy facial recognition software as part of their security system. This is outside our control but may be part of the venue's broader security measures. Employees should familiarize themselves with the privacy policies of any third-party venue they attend.

### Legal Compliance
- **Data Controller Responsibility:** For CCTV systems directly controlled in specific cases, we will act as the **data controller** and ensure compliance with relevant privacy laws, including registering CCTV systems with the appropriate supervisory authority if required.
- **Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA):** A DPIA will be conducted prior to any direct deployment of CCTV systems, considering the risks to individual privacy. For shared venues, employees are encouraged to request a copy of the venue’s DPIA or privacy policy to understand their data practices.

### Key Takeaways:
- **Limited Control:** We do not have full control over CCTV practices in temporary offices, co-working spaces, or event venues. Surveillance may be constant, and advanced technologies like facial recognition may be used without direct consent.
- **Stay Informed:** Employees should proactively check the privacy policies of venues before attending in-person events and should raise concerns about any unexpected use of CCTV or surveillance technology.

## Stay Sharp in Public Spaces

- **Keep Close:** Never leave sensitive documents or devices unattended.
- **Carry On:** Take important items with you if there's no secure storage.
- **Be Discreet:** Avoid discussing confidential information where others can hear.
- **Go Mobile:** Use a mobile hotspot instead of public Wi-Fi.

## Paper Records: Handle with Care

### Minimize and Secure
- **Go Digital:** Prefer digital formats for reports and documents.
- **Lock It Up:** Store sensitive paper records in locked cabinets or a fireproof safe.
- **Label Clearly:** Follow our [Data Classification Guidelines](#).
- **Secure Storage:** Ensure paper records are secure when you're not at your desk.

### Dispose and Protect
- **Shred It Right:** Destroy sensitive paper records using a cross-cut shredder (DIN P4 or above).
- **Vet Services:** Only use thoroughly vetted external disposal services.
- **Treat with Care:** Handle external media like USB drives as carefully as paper records.

## Travel Smart: Keep Data Safe on the Go
