## Why Patching Matters

Think of patching as the superhero shield for the tech world. It protects us from vulnerabilities and keeps our systems in top shape. We focus on securing our exposed assets and reducing technical debt. Here’s the scoop on how we do it:

## The Patch Management Process

### Always on Guard: Spotting Vulnerabilities

- **Constant Watch:** We’re always on the lookout for vulnerabilities in our devices and infrastructure with centralized monitoring.

- **Third-Party Software:** We make sure our third-party software stays secure and works well.

- **Smart Detection:** Our automated Vulnerability Assessment System (VAS), quickly spots any weak points.

### Stay in the Loop: Getting Patch Notifications

- **Multiple Channels:** We get patch alerts through email, auto-updates, and vendor notifications.

- **Timely Updates:** As soon as updates are available, we know about them.

- **Convenient Application:** If an update won't disrupt things, apply it when it suits you.

### Safety First: Testing and Evaluating Patches

- **Controlled Environment:** We test patches in a setup that’s just like our real environments to ensure they work smoothly.

- **Thorough Checks:** We assess patches for functionality, compatibility, and security impact.

- **Ready to Rollback:** If something goes wrong, we’ve got rollback procedures in place.

- **Smart Scheduling:** We consider several factors when scheduling updates:
  - How critical the system is
  - Time needed for installation
  - Threat level of the vulnerabilities
  - Coordination with other updates
  - Dependencies between updates

### Swift and Sure: Deploying Patches

- **Critical Issues:** Patched within 24 hours after testing.
- **High Priority:** Patched within 48 hours after testing.
- **Medium Priority:** Patched within 7 days after testing.
- **Low Priority:** Patched within 14 days after testing.
- **Tracking Success:** We track and report how well patches are deployed.
- **BYOD Encouragement:** Users should apply patches on their devices and report any issues.

Cloud service providers may manage vulnerability assessment and patching for some or all aspects of their services, which is beyond our control.

### Auto-Updates: Set It and Forget It

Auto-updates are a breeze and keep our systems secure without lifting a finger. All devices and software are set to update themselves by default, so we always have the latest security patches. If we need to skip an auto-update, we handle it manually and make sure it’s well-documented. We monitor the system to ensure it works well and make tweaks as needed. This way, we’re not just secure; we’re smartly secure.

## Tackling Patching Challenges

### Navigating the Patch Maze

- **Balancing Act:** We know patching can take time and money. We plan carefully to balance security with practicality.

- **Working Within Limits:** Not all equipment can be patched, so we work within these limits to mitigate threats as effectively as possible using threat modelling.

### Partnering with Vendors

- **Teamwork:** We work with vendors to explore solutions and understand patch details.

- **Quick Fixes:** Vendor collaboration helps us resolve security issues faster.

### Keeping Records

- **Detailed Logs:** We keep detailed records of all patch activities, including deployment logs and testing results.

- **Regular Analysis:** We track metrics like time-to-patch and success rates to keep improving our process.

### Ready for Anything: Incident Response Integration

Our patch management process ties into our incident response plans to handle vulnerabilities until patches are available. Have a look at our [Incident Response Plan](#).

### Promoting Security Awareness

We have a public process to manage and disclose vulnerabilities responsibly.
