A writing style guide is more than a set of rules—it’s a foundation for clarity, accountability, and measurable impact. Tailored to meet the needs of every writer and reviewer, this guide ensures:

- **Clarity:** Simplifies complex ideas and avoids ambiguity.
- **Accountability:** Sets clear expectations for quality.
- **Consistency:** Maintains a unified approach to tone and structure.
- **Actionable value:** Focuses on delivering practical, measurable outcomes.

## Tone and voice

### Key characteristics
- **Professional but approachable:** Writing must convey expertise while remaining accessible and respectful. Avoid unnecessary complexity or ambiguity to ensure clarity.
- **Neutral and balanced:** Objectivity must be maintained by avoiding exaggerated claims, dramatic statements, or personal bias.
- **Collaborative and inclusive:** Language must foster cooperation and inclusivity by avoiding aggressive metaphors, exclusionary phrases, or any language that creates barriers.
- **Action-oriented:** The focus must remain on practical guidance, emphasizing what readers can do or achieve.

### Example
- **Avoid:** “Our groundbreaking approach is guaranteed to transform your business!”
- **Use:** “This approach helps streamline operations and improve workflows.”

## Formatting standards

### Sentence case for headings
- All headings and subheadings must use sentence case to maintain a consistent, understated tone. Only capitalize the first word and proper nouns.

### Example
- **Avoid:** “Why You Should Use This Method”
- **Use:** “Why you should use this method”

## Avoiding hyperbole and superlatives

### Explanation
Hyperbole refers to exaggerated claims not meant to be taken literally, such as “the best ever” or “completely flawless.” Superlatives are adjectives or adverbs in their extreme form, like “best,” “most efficient,” or “fastest.” These create unrealistic expectations and undermine credibility.

### Guidelines
- Writing must be factual and focus on measurable results. Words like “best,” “amazing,” or “incredible” must be avoided. Use specific examples or data to support claims.

### Example
- **Avoid:** “This is the fastest and most effective way to boost productivity.”
- **Use:** “This approach improves productivity by focusing on reducing distractions and enabling deep work.”

## How to use this guide

### Steps to apply this guide
- Begin by reviewing tone and voice guidelines to align your draft with professional and approachable standards.
- Use formatting principles to ensure consistent and clear structure.
- Incorporate practical advice and examples to make communication relatable and actionable.
- Replace any exclusionary language with inclusive terms.
- Address challenges early, seeking clarification to avoid miscommunication.

### Example
- **Avoid:** “Without this strategy, teams will constantly struggle to stay organized.”
- **Use:** “This strategy helps teams stay organized and complete tasks more efficiently.”

## Clarity and conciseness

### Guidelines
- Language must be simple, direct, and concise to ensure clarity and prevent misinterpretation. Avoid unnecessary jargon or overly complex sentences.
- Ideas must be broken down into short, digestible sentences or bulleted lists when appropriate.

### Example
- **Avoid:** “The implementation of this methodology necessitates the identification of inefficiencies and their mitigation through iterative processes.”
- **Use:** “This method identifies inefficiencies and addresses them through step-by-step improvements.”

## Providing context with examples

### Guidelines
- Specific, relatable examples must be used to illustrate key points and make abstract concepts tangible and actionable.
- Context for technical terms or methods must be provided.

### Example
- **Avoid:** “This tool is effective.”
- **Use:** “This tool allows you to manage projects by organizing tasks into clear categories and assigning deadlines.”

## Inclusive and collaborative language

### Guidelines
- Militaristic or aggressive metaphors (e.g., “conquer,” “target,” “dominate”) must be avoided. Language must encourage collaboration and inclusivity.
- Exclusionary terms must be replaced with inclusive language that fosters collaboration and mutual respect.

### Example
- **Avoid:** “We need to conquer this market.”
- **Use:** “We aim to build strong connections within this market.”

## Practical and actionable focus

### Guidelines
- Actionable advice and steps that readers can implement must be emphasized. Focus must remain on solutions rather than dwelling on problems.

### Example
- **Avoid:** “Interruptions can harm productivity.”
- **Use:** “Reduce interruptions by scheduling dedicated focus time and minimizing notifications.”
