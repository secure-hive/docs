## Why Your Role Matters

Your role is key to keeping our assets safe and effectively managed. Effective asset management helps control costs and extends the lifespan of our resources. By ensuring that assets are properly maintained and used efficiently, you help reduce unnecessary expenses and maximize the value of each asset over time.

This guide shows you exactly what you need to do to ensure our resources are protected, cost-effective, and used appropriately.

## What You Need to Do

We handle various assets—hardware, software, data—all tied to specific job roles. f you oversee certain assets, here’s what’s expected:

- **Classify Correctly:** Assign the right classification to your assets. Check the [Information Classification](#information-classification-make-it-simple-make-it-secure) section below to get it right.

- **Control Access:** Manage who can access your assets. Follow our [Access Management Procedures](/access-management-procedures) for step-by-step guidance.

- **Handle and Dispose Properly:** Use and dispose of assets according to the rules. Refer to our [Data Destruction Procedures](/data-destruction-procedures) to ensure compliance.

## Asset Ownership: What It Means for You

Owning assets in your role means managing them responsibly. Here’s what you need to do:

- **Stay in Control:** Oversee the management and protection of the assets assigned to you. For system-specific details, see the [Systems Configuration Guidelines](/systems-configuration-guidelines).

- **Delegate Wisely:** You can delegate tasks, but remember—you’re still responsible for how the assets are used and managed.

- **Set Clear Rules:** Make sure there are clear guidelines on how to handle and use the assets.

- **Keep Everyone in the Loop:** Communicate asset management procedures and any updates to all relevant stakeholders.

By following these steps, you help keep everything running smoothly and securely.

## Obtaining Essential Gear

When it comes to purchasing gear, we use specific channels to ensure quality, discounts, and proper integration:

- **Apple Devices:** All Apple devices are purchased through Apple Business. This not only provides us with discounts but also automatically places the device in Apple Business Manager, allowing for auto-enrolment into our management systems.

- **Other Devices:** For non-Apple devices, purchases are made from [Amazon UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/) or directly from [Logitech](https://www.logitech.com/), depending on which is cheaper at the time.

- **Insurance:** Any big-ticket electronic item worth more than £300.00 is insured with extra coverage to protect against loss or damage. For Example Apple Care for Apple devices.

- **End of Life:** When a device reaches its end of life, it is replaced within one month. Refer to the [Patch Management Policy](/patch-management-policy) for more details on this process.
- **Tracking Purchases:** All asset purchases are tracked in the Purchasing Board, which also records requests for assets and manages approvals. Keeping everything organized on this board ensures transparency and accountability in our purchasing process.

If you're interested in acquiring a pre-owned gear, such as end-of-life equipment, you can purchase it at a discount with written approval. Before the gear is transferred to you, we'll make sure it's fully removed from our management systems, such as the Mobile Device Management (MDM) system used for device management.

Please be aware that delivery costs are separate and will be your responsibility.

## Returning Assets: When Your Role Changes or You Leave

If you move to a new role or leave the company, return all assets you have. We manage data with tools like Mobile Device Management (MDM), but if you prefer, you can erase company data from your personal devices for peace of mind. Full instructions are in the [Asset Return and Data Management Procedures](/asset-return-data-management-procedures).

## Handling Client Assets and Data: Keep It Simple, Keep It Secure

Here’s how to manage client assets and data without hassle:

- **Return on Time:** At the end of your engagement, return all client assets as instructed to honour our commitments and acknowledge the client's ownership.

- **Follow Data Rules:** After finishing a project, make sure client data not stored in their systems is handled according to our client [offboarding-procedures](#).

- **Work Within Their Systems:** Prioritize working within the client’s environment to reduce unnecessary data transfers. For detailed guidance, see our [Client Environment Work Procedures](/client-environment-work-procedures).

- **Retain What’s Needed:** Keep essential records and notes as per our [Data Retention Policy](/data-retention-policy).

- **Anonymize with Permission:** If you need to keep anonymized versions of work, get written permission from the client first to ensure confidentiality.

## Information Classification: Simpler Than You Think

Classify information accurately to safeguard it based on its sensitivity and significance:

- **Public:** Open to everyone, like marketing materials. No special marking needed.
- **Confidential:** Requires protection, like customer data or internal documents.
- **Classified:** Highly sensitive, such as trade secrets. Needs the highest level of protection.

When classifying information, consider:

1. Legal requirements.
2. The value to the company.
3. The importance to company operations.
4. Risks of unauthorized access or changes.

**Label Clearly:** Mark all classified information visibly so everyone knows how to handle it.

{{< callout context="note" title="Note" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
Put labels on physical assets where they’re easy to see, like the front or top. For digital assets, include labels in file metadata or make them prominent within the system. Use labels that resist dust and water and won’t cause damage.

## Secure Communication: Protecting Information the Right Way

When sharing sensitive information, use the right tools:

- **End-to-End Encryption:** This ensures only the intended users can read the messages, even the service providers can’t access them. Perfect for secure communication.
- **Zero-Knowledge Platforms:** These store data in a way that even the provider can’t decrypt. It adds another layer of protection.

These methods ensure client data stays confidential and secure.

## Storing Physical Assets: Keeping Things Safe

Store physical assets in secure locations to limit access to authorized personnel and reduce risks. Use lockable storage or secure rooms whenever possible. More details are in the [Physical Security Policy](/physical-security-policy).

## Handling Data on Removable Media: Stay Safe, Stay Compliant

Only use removable media for company data if it’s absolutely necessary and approved:

- **Use Approved Media:** Stick to media provided or approved by the company.
- **Encrypt Everything:** Always encrypt sensitive data with company-approved tools.
- **Transfer Securely:** Whenever possible, use secure digital methods instead of physical media. If you must use removable media, follow the [Media Handling Procedures](/media-handling-procedures).

This ensures our data remains protected.

## Keeping Asset Records Accurate: Update as You Go

Whenever an asset is returned, dispatched, or changes hands, update the asset record in the inventory system. This ensures accurate asset tracking. Follow the [Record-Keeping Procedures](/record-keeping-procedures) to stay organized.

## Reporting Lost or Stolen Assets: Act Fast

If an asset goes missing or is stolen, take these steps right away:

1. **Report It:** Email security immediately. Check the [Incident Reporting Policy](/incident-reporting-policy) for details.
2. **Wipe the Data:** Use the [BYOD or Mobile Device Policy](/byod-mobile-device-policy) to erase data from lost or stolen devices.
3. **File a Police Report:** Document the loss with a police report. This is crucial for recovery and insurance purposes.
