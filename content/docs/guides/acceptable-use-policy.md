To keep your Internet use more secure, we log web content filtering data for three months, recording only the domains visited—not your IP addresses. This complies with UK privacy standards.

## Allowing Affiliate and Tracking Domains

Affiliate and tracking domains common on deal websites, in emails, or in search results because these are typically accessed after you manually click a link, helping you find deals and discounts safely they are allowed by default.

## Embrace Productivity Freedom with BYOD

When accessing any data classified other than Public on your mobile device, it will automatically be equipped with a Mobile Device Management (MDM) profile, including our web content filtering profile.

For detailed setup instructions, refer to the [BYOD configuration guide](#).

Accidents happen. If you accidentally access a blocked or inappropriate site, report it to Security immediately. As long as the access was unintentional and reported promptly, you won’t face disciplinary action.

## Internet for Work: Your Digital Toolbox

Use the Internet for tasks that help you excel in your role:
